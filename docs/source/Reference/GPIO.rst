GPIO boot states
----------------

Via the web interface (tab "Hardware"), GPIO pins can be set to some initial state at boot.

* Default (INPUT)
* Output Low
* Output High
* Input Pull-up

A GPIO pin used as input may need a pull-up or pull-down resistor to make the observed signal less susceptible to noise.
For example cables may act as an antenna and thus pick up noise.
If such a cable is not 'terminated' or pulled to a certain level, it may give incorrect readings.

It is good practice to enable internal (or external) pull-up or pull-down resistors
to unused pins to make sure they do not cause undefined or unexpected behavior.

Some boards already have pull-up or pull-down resistors mounted on the board itself, or present in connected sensors.
When already present, there is no need to enable pull-up or pull-down resistors on those input pins.
It may even harm stability of the observed signal.

The value of an internal pull-up resistor is between 30 kOhm and 100 kOhm.

Best pins to use on ESP8266
---------------------------

Most board do not have made all pins available.
The NodeMCU boards have almost all usable pins made available and some which need special attention.

Special notes on GPIO 6 - 11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost any ESP8266 board has a flash chip connected to some or all of GPIO6-GPIO11.

GPIO 9 & 10 can be used on ESP8285, since that chip has 1 MB flash embedded and is not using those pins.
One or both of pins may sometimes also be available on ESP8266 boards, depending on the flash used and the flash operation mode.

* Quad IO (QIO) uses 4 lines for data (6 pins total)
* Dual IO (DIO) uses 2 lines for data (4 pins total)
* Standard uses a single line for data (3 pins total)

It is best not to use any of the GPIO pins 6 - 11.


Special notes on GPIO 16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GPIO-16 is a special pin.
The RTC will send a short (low) pulse when the sleep timer does send a wake-up signal.

In order to wake from deep sleep, GPIO-16 has to be connected to the RST pin.
If connected, this pin should not be used as GPIO pin, or else the module will reboot.

Other limitations are:

* GPIO16 has a built-in pull-down resistor (all others have built-in pull-up)
* To enable the pull-down resistor for GPIO16, you have to use ``INPUT_PULLDOWN_16``

This pin is disabled to be set as boot state pin, since it can be connected to the RST pin to allow deep sleep.
If connected to RST, any toggle to "high" will cause a reset, which makes it
impossible to recover from an incorrect configuration.


Best pins to use on ESP32
-------------------------

There is also a NodeMCU version using the ESP32.
Fortunately the designers used the GPIO numbers as labels on the board.

Special notes on GPIO 6 - 11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost any ESP32 board has a flash chip connected to some or all of GPIO6-GPIO11.

It is best not to use any of the GPIO pins 6 - 11.

GPIO 6, 7 & 8 may output some PWM signals at boot.
GPIO 9, 10 & 11 output high at boot and may fail to boot of pulled either high or low.
